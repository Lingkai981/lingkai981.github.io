Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate at [Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/) (2023â€“present), advised by Prof. [Xuemin Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j6rglkYAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Long Yuan](https://longyuancn.github.io/). I received my Masterâ€™s degree from Guangzhou University in June 2023. Before that, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in June 2020.

Interests
======
My research interests mainly focus on large-scale data management, graph data mining, and data compression, with a special emphasis on exploring the synergy between graph data management and Large Language Models (LLMs) / multi-agent systems. Specifically, my research spans the following directions:

- Graph Data Management and Mining: index-based structural clustering on directed graphs, densest subgraph discovery, butterfly counting on streaming bipartite graphs, community search, and revisiting graph analytics benchmarks.

- Data Compression and Storage: high-ratio compression for machine-generated data, efficient storage methods for string data, and novel approaches for large-scale data efficiency.

- LLM & Muti-Agents: usability evaluation frameworks for open-source software (OSS-UAgent), integrating agent-based methods into database usability, and exploring intelligent database kernels.

I aim to bridge graph algorithms, data systems, and LLM-driven approaches, working toward impactful and innovative solutions for managing the ever-growing scale and complexity of real-world data.
