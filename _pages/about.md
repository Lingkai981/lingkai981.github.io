Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate at [Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/) (2023â€“present), advised by Prof. [Xuemin Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j6rglkYAAAAJ&hl=en), with Prof. [Long Yuan](https://longyuancn.github.io/) as co-supervisor. I received my Masterâ€™s degree from Guangzhou University in June 2023. Before that, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in June 2020.

Interests
======
My research focuses on **large-scale data management, graph mining, and data compression**, with a particular interest in combining **graph data systems with Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems**.  

Key directions include:  
- **Graph Data**: clustering, subgraph discovery, streaming analysis, and benchmarking  
- **Data Systems**: high-ratio compression, efficient storage, and scalability  
- **LLMs & Agents**: usability evaluation, agent-based databases, and intelligent kernels  

I aim to bridge graph algorithms, data systems, and LLM-driven approaches to address the scale and complexity of real-world data.
