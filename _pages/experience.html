      <ul>
        <li>Researched clustering-based general compression methods for semi-structured data such as logs and JSON, and explored the application of <em>learned index</em> in key-value index scenarios to reduce storage costs.</li>
        <li>Designed a simple compression framework based on clustering results and implemented a compression evaluation algorithm to measure the compression ratio on different datasets; later focused on coding algorithm implementation.</li>
        <li>Internship lasted until the end of 2022, with outcomes planned for publication in research papers.</li>

        <li>Designed a transaction cycle detection scheme under specific constraints, targeting anti-money laundering and anti-fraud scenarios.</li>
        <li>Pre-computed candidate sets for each edge to reduce redundant checks during queries.</li>
        <li>Adopted <strong>Forward Star</strong> data structure and multi-threading to accelerate query performance.</li>
        <li>Proposed a bi-directional cycle query method based on DFS: for each vertex, only half a cycle needed to be discovered in each direction, significantly improving efficiency.</li>
